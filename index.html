    Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence
    exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of
    research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software
    that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and
    intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving
    defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.

    AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science.
    Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g.,
    Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and
    Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and
    Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools
    (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy
    games (e.g., chess and Go).[2] However, many AI applications are not
    perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general
    applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes
    useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.

  <h2>Reasoning and problem-solving</h2>

    Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning
    that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[16] By
    the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain
    or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and
    economics.[17] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large
    reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They
    become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[18] Even humans rarely use
    the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve
    most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[19] Accurate and
    efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.

  <h2>Types of artificial intelligence</h2>

    Artificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on
    stages of development or actions being performed. For instance, four stages
    of AI development are commonly recognized. Reactive machines: Limited AI
    that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules.
    Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBM’s Deep Blue
    that beat chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive
    machine. Limited memory: Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory.
    It can use memory to improve over time by being trained with new data,
    typically through an artificial neural network or other training model. Deep
    learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory
    artificial intelligence. Theory of mind: Theory of mind AI does not
    currently exist, but research is ongoing into its possibilities. It
    describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making
    capabilities equal to that of a human, including recognizing and remembering
    emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would. Self aware: A
    step above theory of mind AI, self-aware AI describes a mythical machine
    that is aware of its own existence and has the intellectual and emotional
    capabilities of a human. Like theory of mind AI, self-aware AI does not
    currently exist. A more useful way of broadly categorizing types of
    artificial intelligence is by what the machine can do. All of what we
    currently call artificial intelligence is considered artificial “narrow”
    intelligence, in that it can perform only narrow sets of actions based on
    its programming and training. For instance, an AI algorithm that is used for
    object classification won’t be able to perform natural language processing.
    Google Search is a form of narrow AI, as is predictive analytics, or virtual
    assistants. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be the ability for a
    machine to “sense, think, and act” just like a human. AGI does not currently
    exist. The next level would be artificial superintelligence (ASI), in which
    the machine would be able to function in all ways superior to a human.
